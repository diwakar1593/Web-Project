## Description

This project is a web-based Tic Tac Toe game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play the classic Tic Tac Toe game in two different modes: double player and single player against the computer.

## Features

  - Double Player: Two users can play against each other on the same device.
  - Single Player: One user can play against the computer, which employs a simple AI algorithm to make moves.

- Interactive Gameplay:
  - Users can click on the cells to make their moves during the game.
  - The game interface updates in real-time to show the moves made by each player.

- Win and Draw Detection:
  - The game accurately detects when a player wins the game or when the game ends in a draw.
  - Winning combinations are visually highlighted to indicate the winning move.


## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Future Enhancements

This project can be further improved with the following enhancements:

- Implementing different difficulty levels for the AI in single-player mode.
- Adding animations and sound effects to enhance the user experience.
- Implementing an option to allow players to choose their symbols (X or O) before starting the game.
